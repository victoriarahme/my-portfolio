        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name's Victoria. I'm currently a computer programming student at Humber Polytechnic. Ever since I was a teen, I've been very passionate about technology.
            I used to love playing around with html on Tumblr, and spent most of my time obsessed with computers. I graduated with my first diploma in hospitality in 2019 and have worked within
            the industry ever since. After spending quite a few years in the administrative side of things, I started to feel like something was missing. The challenge and problem solving aspect of 
            Computer programming really appealed to me. This curiousity is what pushed me to go back to school. I love any type of work thats engaging and can keep me on my toes - and I think I've found just that!
            I have dreams of pursuing a career in front end developement or UX design, and hope to apply my attention to detail to make beautiful web pages.
