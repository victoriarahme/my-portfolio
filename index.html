        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name's Victoria. I'm currently a computer programming student at Humber Polytechnic. Ever since I was a teen, I've been very passionate about technology.
            I used to love playing around with html on Tumblr, and spent most of my time obsessed with computers. I graduated with my first diploma in hospitality in 2019 and have worked within
            the industry ever since. After spending quite a few years in the administrative side of things, I started to feel like something was missing. The challenge and problem solving aspect of 
            Computer programming really appealed to me. This curiousity is what pushed me to make a change. I love any type of work thats engaging and can keep me on my toes - and I think I've found just that!
            I have dreams of pursuing a career in front end developement or UX design, and hope to apply my attention to detail to make beautiful web pages.
